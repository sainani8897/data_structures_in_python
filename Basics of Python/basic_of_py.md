# Basics of python

## Variables
variables are a very important part of any programming language
In Python, a variable is a name that refers to a value stored in the computer's memory. You can assign different types of values such as numbers, strings, and lists to a variable using the equals sign (=).

```
x = 5 
name = "Alice"
```

Python is a dynamically-typed language, so you don't need to declare the type of a variable before using it. You can change the value of a variable at any time by assigning a new value to it.

```
x = 7
```

Python also allows you to assign multiple variables at once using a technique called "unpacking".
```
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
```
You can also assign the same value to multiple variables at once.
```
x = y = z = 0
```
